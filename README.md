No mandir is complete without a traditional **[brass puja thali set](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/puja-thali-set)**. It’s a core item used daily for performing aarti and offering bhog. Choose a set that includes compartments for diya, roli, chawal, and incense.

Symbolizing purity and divine energy, lotus hangings are often linked to Goddess Lakshmi. Option for intricately carved lotus decor pieces — either as wall hangings or as accents for your pooja room entrance.

## 4. Incense Burner

A **[brass incense burner with handle](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/akhand-jyot-for-pooja-loban-incense-burner-with-handle)** adds fragrance and divinity to your mandir. It not only purifies the air but also creates a calm spiritual ambiance that enhances prayer time.

Add a few decorative mandir bells for that soft chime which marks the beginning and end of your prayers. Bells are considered sacred because their sound drives away negativity and invites divine energies.

## 6. Decorative Diyas
<img width="720" height="720" alt="0_EzvFF5COHz9vFfSN" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9715d3d-5bee-4d3b-9094-89ce77c9ded9" />

The soft glow of diyas holds deep symbolic meaning — light triumphs over darkness. Try a set like the **[metal urli diya set of 56](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/urli-with-56-diya)** with multiple brass diyas arranged beautifully to create a spiritual aura during evening aarti.

## 7. Urli Decorations

Urli bowls filled with water, flower petals, and **[urli diya stand-2 tier](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/urli-diya)** add a traditional charm. For a rustic twist, place **[wooden candle holders](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/handcrafted-wooden-candle-holder-stand-set-of-3)** around the urli setup — they provide a soft, earthy glow that blends tradition with elegance.

## 8. Bhog Thali

Presenting food to your deities in a bhog thali is an essential part of most Indian rituals. Choose a brass or silver set with matching katoris, thali, and glass — they elevate the overall presentation of the bhog offering.

## 9. Pooja Mat

Choose a richly textured pooja mat made of velvet or cotton to sit on while offering prayers. You can also place one under the idols for added elegance and warmth.

## 10. God Idols

Having beautifully carved **[god idols](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/bhakti-idols)** is the soul of any pooja space. A **[marble laxmi ganesh murti](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/white-marble-look-laxmi-ganesh-murti-statue-for-dipawali-pujan)** or other sacred deities like Krishna, Durga, or Shiva brings devotion and divine blessings to your home.

## 11. Hawan Kund
